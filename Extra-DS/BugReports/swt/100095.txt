[DND] Consider making URLTransfer public
I already read a comment by Veronika, that URLTransfer is intentionally not public, because it is not yet fully implemented on all platforms. But could'nt you make it public and provide some fake implementation for platforms that are not yet implemented? Just for example, System Tray is active, though not implemented on all OS. Same to the Browser widget. It would be sad to loose URLTransfers existing functionality on Windows. The reason I am asking is because URLTransfer is the only Transfer that allows to easily read the URL out of a DND from the Internet Explorer. Even Firefox is not supporting DND from the IE. Ben
