Spinner does not allow min == max
R3.1 Build id: I20050627-1435 In the following, the setMaximum has no effect: Spinner spinner = new Spinner(parent, SWT.NONE); spinner.setMinimum(1); spinner.setMaximum(1); The maximum is ignored, keeping the default of 100. In setMaximum there is the following code: if (value &lt;= min [0]) return; Likewise, setMinimum has: if (value &gt;= max [0]) return; It should be possible to restrict the range to a single value. In my scenario, I'm working on an example app that lets you choose the number of people buying a given activity as part of an adventure package, where the max should be the head count for the package. The default is 1.
