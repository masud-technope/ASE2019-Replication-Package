Table column header stays pressed if mouse button released elsewhere
3.1 RC1, Windows XP - open the tasks view - click on the &quot;Resource&quot; Column and release to sort the table. Note that the column header is inset while pressing down and then restores to normal look on release. - now press down on the &quot;Location&quot; column but drag the mouse off the view before releasing the mouse button. Problem: The &quot;Location&quot; column keeps its &quot;depressed&quot; look until another column is clicked. This can mislead one into thinking the table is sorted by the wrong column. Not sure if this is SWT or JFace...
