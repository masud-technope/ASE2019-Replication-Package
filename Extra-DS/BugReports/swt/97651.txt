tree insert mark cheese
3.1RC1 - run the snippet below - the insert line is set to be under the &quot;root&quot; item - collapse the root item -&gt; problem 1: this makes most of the insert line go away, except for its pointy ends. This line should not go away because it belongs to the &quot;root&quot; item, not to the &quot;child&quot; item, but if it really wants to go away, then its end tips should not be left - press the button to the right of the Table: this does a Tree.redraw(), and note that the insert line reappears, so I guess it never really meant to go away -&gt; problem 2: now expand the root item again and its insert mark gets copied to below the child item in addition to its initial location. This is cheese, as can be seen by damaging part of this line with another window public static void main(String[] args) { final Display display = new Display(); final Shell shell = new Shell(display); shell.setBounds(10, 10, 300, 300); final Tree tree = new Tree(shell, SWT.NONE); tree.setBounds(10, 10, 200, 200); new TreeItem(tree, SWT.NONE).setText(&quot;pre-root&quot;); TreeItem root1 = new TreeItem(tree, SWT.NONE); root1.setText(&quot;root&quot;); TreeItem child = new TreeItem(root1, SWT.NONE); child.setText(&quot;child&quot;); Button button = new Button(shell, SWT.PUSH); button.setBounds(230,10,30,30); button.addSelectionListener(new SelectionAdapter() { public void widgetSelected(SelectionEvent e) { tree.redraw(); } }); root1.setExpanded(true); tree.setInsertMark(root1, false); shell.open(); while (!shell.isDisposed()) { if (!display.readAndDispatch()) display.sleep(); } display.dispose(); }
