Program API does not work with GNOME 2.8 (libgnomevfs-WARNING)
I200411170800-gtk Not sure what triggers it, neither who is doing it. I get the following stderr output once in a while: (&lt;unknown&gt;:27693): libgnomevfs-WARNING **: Deprecated function. User modifications to the MIME database are no longer supported. In my development workbench, the output reads: (Gecko:11501): libgnomevfs-WARNING **: Deprecated function. User modifications to the MIME database are no longer supported. So I suspect the mozilla/gecko library is doing this, hence I punted it to SWT. Probably nothing we can do much about, but here's the bug anyway.
