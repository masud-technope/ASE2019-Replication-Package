[consistency] forceActive and setActive are inconsistent across platforms
If a shell that hasn't been opened is forced active: on windows and mac, the current app loses focus, the shell becomes active, but can't be seen. on gtk and motif, if the shell isn't visible, nothing is done. import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display; import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Shell; public class pr79504 { public static void main(String[] args) { final Display display = new Display(); Shell shell = new Shell(display); // shell.setActive(); shell.forceActive(); while (!shell.isDisposed()) { if (!display.readAndDispatch()) display.sleep(); } display.dispose(); } }
