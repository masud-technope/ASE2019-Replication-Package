implement GC.drawFocus
I20041208-gtk GC.drawFocus simply draws a solid line. This is correctly following the javadoc, that says that this may happend if drawing the focus is not supported. However: this seems like a serious limitation to anyone implementing custom widgets. Is there any chance that this will be implemented on GTK? This is really a dup of point 2 of <span class="bz_closed"><a href="show_bug.cgi?id=62424" title="RESOLVED WONTFIX - gc.drawFocus on linux does not use XOR drawing">bug 62424</a></span>, however, it also mentions other things, so I filed this one separately.
