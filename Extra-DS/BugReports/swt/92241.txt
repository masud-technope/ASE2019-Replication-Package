StyledText should not fill the clipboard on every selection change
3.1 stream See <span class="bz_closed"><a href="show_bug.cgi?id=92209" title="RESOLVED FIXED - [implementation] Scrolling performance degrades with size of selection">bug 92209</a></span>. Filling the clipboard with the current selection upon every selection change *really* hurts one test case: selecting big editor areas and changing the selection with the arrow keys and holding shift (or selecting large areas with the mouse). Note that this happens on Windows as well as GTK. IMO, copying the entire (almost) document content upon every selection change is way too expensive. Is there a way to avoid this?
