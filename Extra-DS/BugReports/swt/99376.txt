TableColumn has width=0 and second column missing
31RC2 - Window -&gt; Show View -&gt; Other... - select PDE Runtime - Plug-in Registry, OK - in the opened view, the Table that's to the right of the Tree has two problems: -&gt; column 0 has width 0 (its width can be increased by dragging its separator) -&gt; column 1 seems non-existent
