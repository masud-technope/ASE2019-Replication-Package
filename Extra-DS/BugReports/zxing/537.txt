Barcode is not scanned correclty
1. Scan the attached barcode Type ean13 is correctly identified correctly. But the barcode number is incorrect. Correct number would be: 030000769023 Actual result: 30000769023 What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? Android, 3.4 (Market Version) ean13-test.jpg 102 KB &nbsp; View &nbsp; Download The barcode itself is actually *both* a UPC-A code and EAN-13. EAN-13 is actually a clever superset of UPC-A, designed that way to enable backward compatibility. The scanner simply picks UPC-A here. The only way to differentiate is that there are actually 13 digits printed below. It is EAN-13, so calling it UPC-A is technically off, but I don't think we're going to go to the trouble of disambiguating just for this. Status: WontFix I did try to force EAN-13 by passing it as SCAN_FORMATS but still 30000769023 is the result. Ah I think you have a point here. Internally, when scanning for UPC-A and EAN-13, only one decoder (for EAN-13) is deployed since EAN-13 is a superset. If it finds a barcode starting with 0 it construes it as UPC-A. That's a nice trick, but, is not correct when UPC-A is not allowed as a barcode format. In this case it should just return the 13-digit value. I can fix that I'm pretty sure. It will still come back as UPC-A if scanning for both, but, will come back as EAN-13 if UPC-A is not allowed. Status: AcceptedOwner: srowenLabels: Type-Defect Priority-Medium () Status: Fixed
