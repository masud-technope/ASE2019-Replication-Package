Company field in generator seems not to work
1.go to http://zxing.appspot.com/generator/ 2.try to generate vcard (contact information) 3.the company field seems not to work a qr code with company information ;) no info seems to be taken, in the url http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?... is the company info also not shown What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? chrome 5.0.375.125 on MacOS10.6.4 Some of the tested readers on iphone os 4 has problems with german umlauts (eg ?, ? and so on) but I think that's another problem and not important to you... There is no vCard support and MECARD does not encode company info. Yeah the field really shouldn't be there. I'll delete it but no real plans to update this. Status: AcceptedOwner: srowen Thanks for the quick response ;) vcard was wrong but many readers seems to support ORG in a mecard, but... It's not valid, no. Status: FixedLabels: Type-Defect Priority-Low I was able to add mecard ORG: support. The attached files show the changes. Please keep in mind that I made these changes on version zxing 1.4 changes_to_iphone_code_to_support_org_in_mecard.zip 8.1 KB &nbsp; Download Right, it's not that it would be hard to add that. It's that it's not valid.
