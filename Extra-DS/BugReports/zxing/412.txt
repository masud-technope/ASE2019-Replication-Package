You're running into corner-cases in the "pure barcode" mode. This maybe not surprising since these images aren't a pure barcode, let alone contain a barcode! Why are you using pure barcode mode though? This shouldn't be needed. Status: AcceptedOwner: srowenLabels: -Priority-Medium Priority-Low () Status: Fixed I am using the scanning in batch mode. Only the separator pages would have barcodes. Majority of the pages that I scan do not have any barcode. BTW. Thank you for fixing those issues so quick. If they're scans, even if the pages are really clean scans, you may not want PURE_BARCODE. It gets thrown off easily if it's not actually a pure, exactly oriented image. I would just set TRY_HARDER. But hey if you tried it and it worked better, go ahead.
