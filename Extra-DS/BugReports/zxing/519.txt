wrong alignment position for version 23
http://code.google.com/p/zxing/source/browse/trunk/core/src/com/google/zxing/qrcode/decoder/Version.java#422 new Version(23, new int[]{6, 30, 54, 74, 102}, I don't have a spec to look at but this line is the only one that doesn't follow a regular pattern with constant delta between successive alignment positions. I think the 74 is a typo and should be new Version(23, new int[]{6, 30, 54, 78, 102}, Good eye. Indeed that is the correct value from Table E.1. I'll commit a fix now.
