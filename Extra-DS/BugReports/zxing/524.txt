qrcode::Detector#findAlignmentInRegion needs a Y boundary condition
findAlignmentInRegion checks for bad looking X values but it doesn't seem to be checking for bad looking Y values. I just had a core dump in C++ because the bottom and top values get inverted (due to the image bounds) leading to a negative (or very large, in C++ unsigneds) height. I think it should have a simlar check but wanted to do a sanity check. Probably so, do you have a patch in mind? Owner: smpar...@smparkes.netLabels: Type-Defect Priority-Low Very simple. I'll apply if there no objections. fair.patch 1.6 KB &nbsp; View &nbsp; Download () Status: Fixed
