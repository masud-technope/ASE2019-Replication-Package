AbstractBlackBoxTestCase does not rotate non-square images correctly
The java test driver doesn't rotate images correctly if the image isn't square. Not a huge deal. Mostly the reason for looking into it was the desire to crosscheck the Java with the C++ which doesn't have this issue. Patch attached. It create nine new QR successes. It also creates four new false/partial positives. The new cases are ones where there's already a failure coming from the same image at a different angle (so it's not surprising that now that the images are not getting cropped, they are also getting incorrectly decoded?) rotate.patch 4.6 KB &nbsp; View &nbsp; Download The rotation is right but the resulting image boundary is wrong, is that the issue? OK will have a look when I'm back. Status: AcceptedOwner: srowenLabels: Type-Defect Priority-Low Yeah, sorry. Poor choice of words. It's just that the new image has to be of a different size and that also means that there has to be translation to move the old center to the new center. The patch will actually handle non-90 degree rotations and produce an image of the necessary size and placement. That generality is currently not used, but the general case is easier to code than the special cases. Looks great, will commit. Status: Fixed
