RIM app Crashing!. JVM Exception: ConnectionClosed exception.
1.run ZxingUiApplication inside zxlib 1.5 package. 2.goto snap. 3.take a picture of a QR-code (image obtained from "simulate camera image" in the simulator) the expected output is the app decoding correctly and showing the url. what happens is the JVM Exception 104: ConnectionClosed Exception. can't go anywhere from here.. What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? zxing 1.5. on Blackberry 9800 simulator. Windows XP (on top of Oracle Vbox... for what is worth, all the other apps i have simulated with this system did not presented any problems). maybe is this a problem with the sd-card not being present?. or is it the library decoding the picture having a bug?? thanks for any help. Sounds like a problem simply opening the web page: "connection closed". That's not related to the app. It's not supported anyway. Status: NotABug i'll check with other code images in that case. (i'm also trying now to run the app on the 8530 simulator.) what exactly is not supported?. Nobody hass worked on the BlackBerry client, and don't think there's a plan to, so I don't know what it's status is regarding newer phones / OS / emulator. The error is in com.google.zxing.client.rim => ZxingLMMainScreen.java : In the run() method : file.delete() is called after file.close() in the "finally" block. Thus an ConnectionClosed exception appears. So, call delete() before close(). Hope it helps :) This bug is fixed in another issue. Update : Have a look @ issue 126 :) I see, this works differently than the Java File/FileInputStream, where you'd have to close() the stream then delete() the file. I switched these around and you can try again now. Status: FixedOwner: srowenLabels: Type-Defect Priority-Low Fixed!. changed the 'file.delete()' call as you said. Thanks for the help!.
