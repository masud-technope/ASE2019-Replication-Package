3.22 on Samsung Spica (480x320) shows only 1/4 of magnified screen
Upgrade 3.2 -> 3.22 introduced new bug on Samsung Spica i5700. At 480x320 screen, program shows only left upper corner of camera input. Picture looks twice bigger, than it should be. It's impossible to scan any codes. Rolled back to 3.2, until fixed. I can give you a build that may address this if you'll get me your email address separately. Status: AcceptedOwner: srowenLabels: -Priority-Medium Priority-Low Will be glad to help with testing. vitaly@rcdesign.ru Debug package, you've sent, is ok at spica. I committed my fix to SVN, a change which also ought resolve an issue on the Moment + Android 2.1 Status: Fixed
