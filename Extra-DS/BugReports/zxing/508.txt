Handle boundary conditions in HybridBinarizer a little better
c.f. http://groups.google.com/group/zxing/browse_thread/thread/d410251c3daa73c8 There's actually a comment for this in HB.java, that the last 7 pixels are dropped. This is kind of a boundary case, but given that my (mythical?) users don't really know how to frame codes, I thought I'd look at it. It's actually an easy (and elegant?) fix: when there's a fractional block on the right or bottom, simply compute it using the final 8 pixels. This overlaps with the previous block, but that should be fine. I wouldn't expect any computational impact with this, unless I'm missing something ... hb.patch 8.0 KB &nbsp; View &nbsp; Download Issue 509 has been merged into this issue.
