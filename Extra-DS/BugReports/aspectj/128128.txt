iajc doesn't fail Ant build when compile errors occur.
The iajc ant task doesn't failonerror anymore. The most relevant line is AjcTask.java:1256 with holder.numMessages(IMessage.ERROR, false) always returning 0. The holder:MessageHandler instance delegates messages to an interceptor AntMessageHandler. The AntMessageHandler is (almost) always consuming the messages, leaving the MessageHandler.java:108 to return without recording any messages itself. I would have liked to submit a patch with this bug report but I'm not yet sure what the correct interceptor.handleMessage(message) behavior should be in this case. Note: The AntMessageHandler properly reporting message priorities ("error" vs. "warn") is welcome functionality - thanks.
