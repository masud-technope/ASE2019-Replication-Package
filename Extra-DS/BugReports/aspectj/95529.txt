concrete-aspect
for M4 note: need to think some if we want to jit the concrete aspect, or if its not that needed ie that the shadow munger API allow us to do what we need (perhaps not easy to deal with perClause and uniqueness enforcement of concrete-aspect name, but perhaps a burden as well to deal with jit since then no bytecode can be grabbed from file system ie may confuse the bcel repository and resolvedTypeX and alike) Ideas Andy ? I am more in favor of bytecode gen the concrete aspect there. (that further means the underlying infra needs to support define class callbacks like "acceptClass" thing used for ajc$Closure and alike when running LTW. I am ok with that)
