Weaved code does not include debug lines
I am attempting to use AspectJ and output all classes in debug mode (required by our code coverage instrumentor). However any code introduced by our aspects to production classes does not include debug line information. Our ant script uses the iajc task as follows: <iajc ... debug="true" .. /> We have an aspect that introduces a public, no-arguments constructor into various classes. If I enable this aspect, then do a clean build, I get the following error from our code coverage tool: [jblanket] java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: No line numbers detected in com.abmuk.oms.core.model.core.XMLObject.<init>. Either remove the 'oneLineFile' tag or turn debug on when compiling. If I remove that aspect, we get no errors about debug line information. I've tried debug="true" or debugLevel="lines,vars,source", with no success. This issue is preventing our Unit Test suite from executing. If you require any further information, please don't hesitate to email me. Cheers, Chris Nappin.
