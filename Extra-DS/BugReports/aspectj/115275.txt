aop.xml aspect include
I have a question about load-time weaving in AspectJ. According to the AspectJ 5 Development Kit Developer's Notebook, the <aspects> element can have an <include within="[pattern]"> child element (http://eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/next/adk15notebook/ltw-configuration.html). However, when I include that element as a child to the <aspects> element in my aop.xml file, I get a SAX exception: org.xml.sax.SAXException: Unknown element while parsing <aspectj> element: include Is the <include> element currently supported within the <aspects> element? Or do I have to explicitly list every aspect I want woven at load time using an <aspect name="..."> for each aspect? Basically I do not wish to explicitly ennumerate every aspect in the aop.xml file for the load-time weaver. Rather, I want to use a wildcard pattern to capture them all.
